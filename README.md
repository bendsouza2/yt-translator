# YT-Translator

### Project Overview
This project aims to provide free and accessible language learning resources in the form of video content created leveraging LLMs. THe project was created with Spanish as the target language to learn, and English as the base language. However, this can easily be customised to provide language learning resources for other languages. I have written (detailed documentation)[https://github.com/bendsouza2/yt-translator/tree/main/python/README.md] on the video creation side of the project, which you can (view here)[https://github.com/bendsouza2/yt-translator/tree/main/python/README.md] if you want to clone the project for your own use case. 

The video creation element of the project has been completed as above.

The web backend has been completed and the frontend is at the deployment stage.
